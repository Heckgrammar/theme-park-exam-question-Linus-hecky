      Write a C# program to calculate the total charge for a group of people visiting the theme park.
      The program must:
      • get the user to enter the number of people in a group
      • calculate the total charge by:
          ○ charging £15 per person
          ○ reducing the total charge by £5 if there are six or more people
      • output the total charge.
      You should use meaningful variable name(s) inyour answer.
